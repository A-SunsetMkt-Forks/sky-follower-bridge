## 3. Purpose of Data Use and Legal Basis

## 6. User Rights

Under GDPR, users have the following rights:

1. **Right of Access**: The right to request access to their personal data.  
2. **Right to Rectification**: The right to request the correction of inaccurate or incomplete personal data.  
3. **Right to Erasure (Right to be Forgotten)**: The right to request the erasure of personal data.  
4. **Right to Restrict Processing**: The right to request the restriction of processing of personal data.  
5. **Right to Data Portability**: The right to receive their personal data in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format, or to request the transfer of that data to another controller.  
6. **Right to Object**: The right to object to processing based on legitimate interests.  
7. **Right to Withdraw Consent**: The right to withdraw consent at any time (this does not affect the lawfulness of processing before the withdrawal).

Since this extension only stores personal data (Login ID) in the user’s browser, **users can exercise the right to erasure in practice by uninstalling the extension or manually deleting the data from Local Storage**. Because this data is not saved on our servers, there is no need to contact us directly for deletion, but if you have any questions, please reach out to us at the contact details below.

### Automated Decision-Making (Profiling)
We do not perform automated decision-making or profiling using users’ personal data.

### Right to Lodge a Complaint with a Supervisory Authority
If you reside in an EU or EEA member state, you have the right to lodge a complaint with the Data Protection Authority (DPA) of the country in which you reside regarding our processing of personal data.

## 7. International Data Transfers

We do not transfer users’ personal data outside the European Economic Area (EEA). Additionally, we do not store personal data on our servers, so there is no transfer of data outside the EEA.

## 8. Data Security Measures

- We do not store personal data on our servers; thus, there is no risk of data breach on the server side.  
- We implement appropriate security measures regarding the handling of login information within this extension. However, it is the user’s responsibility to manage and protect data stored in the browser’s Local Storage.

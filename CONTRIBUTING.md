## How to set up a Local Development Environment

```

Install dependent modules with npm.
If you do not have pnpm, please install it beforehand.

When the development server starts, the Extension build results are output to the `extension`.

You can use extensions in your browser by loading the contents of the extensions folder in Chrome Exteinsions.
